Ahoy, fellow hacker! 

You've found my home on the Internet. Here you should expect to read about programming, design,
engineering, and anything else that piques my interest.

I've seen so many programming blogs starting off with an enthusiastic post about the blog's
meticulously-crafted infrastructure, using the latest static-site generator written in the author's
language of choice, and then that post being one of the only entries in the blog. I'll refrain from
that type of post for now with the hopes of not falling into the same trap -- though, I must admit,
it is tempting.
